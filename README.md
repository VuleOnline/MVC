At this stage, the project depicts communication between the client and the server, as well as database manipulation. 
Users can log in as either a regular user (username: 'u', password: 'u') or as an administrator (username: 'a', password: 'a'), 
or register as a new user. If logged in as a regular user, they have access to lists of questions categorized by topics. 
Upon opening a specific list, questions related to that topic will be displayed.

Taking a test is not possible at the moment due to my lack of proficiency in certain technologies (such as JSON). 
I hope to add these functionalities in the future to make the project complete. For users, there are header links 
leading to their homepage ("app"), a link to the list of tests ("Testovi"), and a "Logout" link.

If logged in as an administrator, additional links are available, such as "Svi korisnici" (listing all registered users on 
the site), "Korisnici" (listing non-administrator users), and "Administratori" (listing those with administrative privileges). 
Administrators can manipulate these lists, adding or deleting users, whether they are administrators or not.

On the "Testovi" page for administrators, they can delete an entire list or open a specific list. Additionally, 
administrators can add new questions to be displayed on the list. Choosing the "View" option on the test list allows 
administrators to edit or delete specific questions.

The goal of this project was to incorporate as many functionalities as possible with minimal user interface pages.
